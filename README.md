# Training four Classification Models on Iris Dataset

This project trains four classification models and obtains their accuracy on [the iris data set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris). The dataset is first split into train and test set. Next, SVM, k-nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression and Decision Tree use the training set to train their models. At last, the models' accuracy on test set is computed.

Look at the figures directory to get a visualization of the iris dataset.
